### Animations

Key frame animations with vectors are on our roadmap.

### Nodes

Node render system is what powers such extensive capabilities. All layers, effects and the layer structure are nodes or a result of its connections. PixiEditor exposes node graph for every document, so you are free to customize your image however you want and create procedural art/animations!
